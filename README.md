**Project: Lottery Contract - ChainLink VRF Request**

This smart contract represents a lottery - participants can enter the lottery via the enterLottery() function.

The minimum entry fee is 0.1 ether and is collected as the lottery fund.

A random number is generated by requesting ChainLink oracle's VRF consumer base contract. This number is then used to randomly pick a winner.

Only the owner of this contract can use pickWinner() and the fund is transferred to the winner.

The contract refreshes once a winner is chosen and the winner's address is mapped along with the lotteryId.
